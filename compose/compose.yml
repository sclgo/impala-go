# This defines a basic Impala service with a single Impala Daemon and the minimal set of
# services required to support it. A Hive MetaStore service is used to manage metadata.
# All filesystem data is stored in Docker volumes. The default storage location for tables
# is in the impala-quickstart-warehouse volume, i.e. if you create a table in Impala, it
# will be stored in that volume by default.
#
# impala-go: The compose spec is shortened to simplify using it for testing,
# at the expense of other usage.
